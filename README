CASdesigner is a DJango application that allows for semi-automated design of
DNA for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic editing. It includes experimental data on
genetic parts (integration loci, promoters, protein tags) generated in-house to
help the user select parts that provide a desired expression pattern.

It is part of a toolkit of (1) a Cas9/gRNA system to integrate a markerless
cassette for deletions, mutations, or insertions at a desired chromosomal site,
(2) experimental data on genomic sites, (3) on promoters, and (4) modular
protein tags to control protein localization, stability, and solubility.
Possible uses are to easily design primers to integration expression cassettes.

CASdesigner is running at http://casdesigner.jbei.org/ .


Installation
============
If you know how to use Vagrant [https://www.vagrantup.com/], you can use it to
create a virtual machine with all the prerequisites installed. For consistent
results, please use the official downloads rather than installing from your
package manager.

After installing Vagrant, go to the CASdesigner directory and run

    vagrant up

This will take a while as all the prerequisites are downloaded and installed.
Once it is done, browse to `localhost:7777` to view the notebook (you can change
the port in the Vagrantfile).


Bugs
====
If, when running `vagrant up` you get an error related to vboxsf, follow the step-by-step instructions here [1] to install the Vagrant vbguest plugin which should make the error go away.
